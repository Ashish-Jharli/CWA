            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Another key aspect of ancient education was the establishment of formal
                education. This became necessary since the amount of knowledge grew as civilizations evolved and
                informal education proved insufficient to transmit all knowledge from one generation to the next.
                Teachers would act as specialists to impart knowledge and education became more abstract and further
                removed from daily life. Formal education was still quite rare in ancient societies and was restricted
                to the intellectual elites. It happened in the form of training scribes and priests and covered various
                subjects besides reading and writing, including the humanities, science, medicine, mathematics, law, and
                astrology.[232][155] Plato's Academy in Ancient Greece is often mentioned as one of the noteworthy
                achievements of ancient education. It is frequently described as the first institute of higher
                education.[235][236][237] Another achievement is the creation of the Great Library of Alexandria in
                Ancient Egypt. Many see it as the most prestigious library of the ancient world.[238]</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character
                traits. There are many debates about its precise definition, for example, about which aims it tries to
                achieve. A further issue is whether part of the meaning of education is that the change in the student
                is an improvement. Some researchers stress the role of critical thinking to distinguish education from
                indoctrination. These disagreements affect how to identify, measure, and improve forms of education. The
                term can also refer to the mental states and qualities of educated people. Additionally, it can mean the
                academic field studying education.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The main discipline investigating education is called education studies,
                also referred to as education sciences. It tries to determine how people transmit and acquire knowledge
                by studying the methods and forms of education. It is interested in its aims, effects, and value as well
                as the cultural, societal, governmental, and historical contexts that shape education.[173] Education
                theorists integrate insights from many other fields of inquiry, including philosophy, psychology,
                sociology, economics, history, politics, and international relations. Because of these influences, some
                theorists claim that education studies is not an independent academic discipline like physics or history
                since its method and subject are not as clearly defined.[174][175] Education studies differs from
                regular training programs, such as teacher training, since its focus on academic analysis and critical
                reflection goes beyond the skills needed to be a good teacher. It is not restricted to the topic of
                formal education but examines all forms and aspects of education.</p>
